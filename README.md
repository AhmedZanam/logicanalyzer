# logicanalyzer
Logic Analyzer RPi is a program to use your Raspberry Pi as a Logic Analyzer. It allows you to capture logic states at the GPIO pins (using pull up then pull down resistors of the GPIO). The logic states of the GPIO can be measured up to few kHz, with a very large number of points. The captured data can be saved to or loaded from a file.
